/* Simple program to illustrate the implementation of I/O redirection.
 * This version uses execvp and command-line arguments to create a new process.
 * To Compile: gcc -Wall -o ioredirect ioredirect.c
 * To Run: ./ioredirect <command> [args]
 * The new child process created executes the program <command> by reading 
 * input from the file stdin.txt and writes output to the file stdout.txt.
